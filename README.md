# LSFM tools

A collection of tools for processing light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) data, particularly stage-scan data, written by [James Manton](https://github.com/jdmanton) and [Jérôme Boulanger](https://github.com/jboulanger).
Portable methods are provided for deskewing, deconvolving and projecting volumetric data at high speed without GPU-acceleration.
